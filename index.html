  <h1>Hey my love…</h1>
  <h2>This is something I made just for you 🤍</h2>

  <p>I started talking to you because I wanted to date you. I dated you so I could actually marry you.</p>
  <p>Today, and every day, I still choose you. I choose growing old together, sharing laughter and silence, working through misunderstandings, and standing hand in hand through everything life brings us. </p>
  <p>I know I’m not perfect, and I know I hurt you sometimes—even when I don’t mean to. For that, I am truly sorry. Please know that my heart is always with you, and my intentions are always rooted in love for you.</p>
  <p>A strong marriage isn’t one without fights—it’s one where we fall, learn, forgive, and find our way back to each other again and again. And I promise to keep trying, to keep learning, and to keep choosing you.</p>
  <p>On your birthday, I want you to know how deeply grateful I am for you—for your love, your patience, your strength, and the life we are building together. You are my today, my tomorrow, and my forever.
Happy Birthday, my love.❤️</p>
